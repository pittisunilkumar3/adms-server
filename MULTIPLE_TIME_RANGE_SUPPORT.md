# Multiple Time Range Assignment Support

## Overview
The attendance system now supports **multiple time range assignments** for both staff and students. This allows a single staff member or student to have multiple valid time ranges throughout the day.

---

## ‚ú® What's New?

### Previous Behavior (Single Time Range)
- System would only check the **first** assigned time range
- If punch was outside that range, it would be rejected
- **Problem**: Staff with multiple shifts couldn't punch in different time ranges

### New Behavior (Multiple Time Ranges)
- System retrieves **ALL** assigned time ranges for the user
- Loops through all assigned ranges to find a match
- If punch matches **ANY** assigned range, it's accepted
- **Benefit**: Staff can work multiple shifts and punch in any of their assigned time ranges

---

## üéØ How It Works

### For Staff Members

#### Step 1: Retrieve All Assigned Time Ranges
```php
// Get ALL assigned time ranges for this staff member
$assignedTimeRanges = DB::table('staff_time_range_assignments')
    ->where('staff_id', $staff_id)
    ->where('is_active', 1)
    ->pluck('time_range_id')
    ->toArray();
```

#### Step 2: Get Time Range Details
```php
// Get all assigned time ranges with their details
$timeRanges = BiometricTimingSetup::whereIn('id', $assignedTimeRanges)
    ->where('is_active', 1)
    ->orderBy('priority', 'asc')
    ->get();
```

#### Step 3: Find Matching Time Range
```php
// Loop through all assigned time ranges to find which one matches the punch time
foreach ($timeRanges as $range) {
    if ($range->isTimeInRange($punchTime)) {
        $matchedTimeRange = $range;
        break; // Found a match, stop searching
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Accept or Reject
- **If match found**: Record attendance with matched time_range_id
- **If no match found**: Reject punch and log warning

## üìä Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Staff with Multiple Shifts

**Setup:**
```sql
-- Staff ID 6 has 3 assigned time ranges
INSERT INTO staff_time_range_assignments (staff_id, time_range_id, is_active) VALUES
(6, 1, 1),  -- Morning Check-in: 08:00-09:00
(6, 3, 1),  -- Afternoon Check-in: 13:00-14:00
(6, 5, 1);  -- Evening Check-out: 17:00-19:00
```

**Punch Examples:**

| Punch Time | Result | Matched Range | Reason |
|------------|--------|---------------|--------|
| 08:30 AM | ‚úÖ Accepted | Morning Check-in | Within 08:00-09:00 |
| 10:30 AM | ‚ùå Rejected | None | Not in any assigned range |
| 13:30 PM | ‚úÖ Accepted | Afternoon Check-in | Within 13:00-14:00 |
| 18:00 PM | ‚úÖ Accepted | Evening Check-out | Within 17:00-19:00 |
| 22:00 PM | ‚ùå Rejected | None | Not in any assigned range |

### Scenario 2: Staff with Overlapping Ranges

**Setup:**
```sql
-- Staff ID 7 has overlapping time ranges (priority matters)
INSERT INTO staff_time_range_assignments (staff_id, time_range_id, is_active) VALUES
(7, 1, 1),  -- Morning Check-in: 08:00-09:00 (Priority 1)
(7, 2, 1);  -- Morning Check-in (Late): 09:00-10:00 (Priority 2)
```

**Punch at 08:30 AM:**
- System checks ranges in priority order (1, 2, 3...)
- Matches **Morning Check-in** (Priority 1) first
- Records attendance with time_range_id = 1

---

## üîç Database Queries

### View Staff with Multiple Time Ranges
```sql
SELECT 
    s.id AS staff_id,
    s.name,
    s.employee_id,
    COUNT(stra.id) AS total_ranges,
    GROUP_CONCAT(bts.range_name SEPARATOR ', ') AS assigned_ranges,
    GROUP_CONCAT(CONCAT(bts.time_start, '-', bts.time_end) SEPARATOR ', ') AS time_ranges
FROM staff s
JOIN staff_time_range_assignments stra ON s.id = stra.staff_id
JOIN biometric_timing_setup bts ON stra.time_range_id = bts.id
WHERE stra.is_active = 1
GROUP BY s.id, s.name, s.employee_id
HAVING total_ranges > 1
ORDER BY total_ranges DESC;
```

### View All Assignments for a Specific Staff
```sql
SELECT 
    s.id AS staff_id,
    s.name,
    s.employee_id,
    bts.id AS time_range_id,
    bts.range_name,
    bts.range_type,
    bts.time_start,
    bts.time_end,
    bts.priority,
    stra.is_active
FROM staff_time_range_assignments stra
JOIN staff s ON stra.staff_id = s.id
JOIN biometric_timing_setup bts ON stra.time_range_id = bts.id
WHERE s.id = 6  -- Replace with your staff ID
AND stra.is_active = 1
ORDER BY bts.priority ASC;
```

### Assign Multiple Time Ranges to Staff
```sql
-- Assign multiple time ranges to Staff ID 6
INSERT INTO staff_time_range_assignments (staff_id, time_range_id, is_active, created_at) VALUES
(6, 1, 1, NOW()),  -- Morning Check-in
(6, 3, 1, NOW()),  -- Afternoon Check-in
(6, 5, 1, NOW());  -- Evening Check-out
```

### Remove a Time Range Assignment
```sql
-- Deactivate a specific assignment
UPDATE staff_time_range_assignments 
SET is_active = 0 
WHERE staff_id = 6 AND time_range_id = 3;

-- Or delete it completely
DELETE FROM staff_time_range_assignments 
WHERE staff_id = 6 AND time_range_id = 3;
```

## üîß Configuration Examples

### Example 1: Full-Time Staff (Morning + Evening)
```sql
-- Staff works morning and evening shifts
INSERT INTO staff_time_range_assignments (staff_id, time_range_id, is_active) VALUES
(10, 1, 1),  -- Morning Check-in: 08:00-09:00
(10, 5, 1);  -- Evening Check-out: 17:00-19:00
```

### Example 2: Part-Time Staff (Afternoon Only)
```sql
-- Staff works only afternoon shift
INSERT INTO staff_time_range_assignments (staff_id, time_range_id, is_active) VALUES
(11, 3, 1);  -- Afternoon Check-in: 13:00-14:00
```

### Example 3: Flexible Staff (All Shifts)
```sql
-- Staff can work any shift
INSERT INTO staff_time_range_assignments (staff_id, time_range_id, is_active) VALUES
(12, 1, 1),  -- Morning Check-in: 08:00-09:00
(12, 2, 1),  -- Morning Check-in (Late): 09:00-10:00
(12, 3, 1),  -- Afternoon Check-in: 13:00-14:00
(12, 4, 1),  -- Afternoon Check-out: 15:00-16:00
(12, 5, 1),  -- Evening Check-out: 17:00-19:00
(12, 6, 1);  -- Evening Check-out (Late): 19:00-20:00
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### 1. Priority Matters
- When multiple ranges overlap, the system uses **priority** (lower number = higher priority)
- The first matching range (by priority) is used
- Example: If ranges 1 and 2 both match, range with lower priority number wins

### 2. Unique Constraint
- The table has a **UNIQUE KEY** on `(staff_id, time_range_id)`
- You cannot assign the same time range twice to the same staff member
- Attempting to do so will result in a database error

### 3. Active Status
- Only `is_active = 1` assignments are considered
- Deactivated assignments (`is_active = 0`) are ignored
- This allows temporary disabling without deleting records

### 4. Duplicate Prevention Still Works
- Duplicate prevention is based on: `staff_id + date + time_range_id`
- If staff punches multiple times in the same range on the same date, only the first is recorded
- Staff can punch in different ranges on the same date (e.g., morning check-in + evening check-out)

## üß™ Testing

### Test Case 1: Multiple Valid Punches
```sql
-- Setup: Staff 6 has 3 time ranges
-- Punch 1: 08:30 (Morning) - Should be accepted
-- Punch 2: 13:30 (Afternoon) - Should be accepted
-- Punch 3: 18:00 (Evening) - Should be accepted

-- Expected Result: 3 attendance records with different time_range_id values
SELECT * FROM staff_attendance 
WHERE staff_id = 6 
AND date = CURDATE()
ORDER BY created_at;
```

### Test Case 2: Invalid Punch Between Ranges
```sql
-- Setup: Staff 6 has ranges at 08:00-09:00 and 13:00-14:00
-- Punch: 10:30 (Between ranges) - Should be rejected

-- Expected Result: No attendance record, warning in logs
-- Check logs: grep "REJECTED" storage/logs/laravel.log
```

### Test Case 3: Duplicate in Same Range
```sql
-- Setup: Staff 6 has Morning range (08:00-09:00)
-- Punch 1: 08:30 - Should be accepted
-- Punch 2: 08:45 - Should be rejected (duplicate)

-- Expected Result: Only 1 attendance record
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM staff_attendance 
WHERE staff_id = 6 
AND date = CURDATE()
AND time_range_id = 1;
-- Should return: 1
```

---

## üìà Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Staff can work multiple shifts per day
2. **Accuracy**: System matches punch to correct time range automatically
3. **Scalability**: Supports any number of time range assignments
4. **Priority-Based**: Handles overlapping ranges intelligently
5. **Audit Trail**: Logs show which range was matched and total assigned ranges
6. **Duplicate Prevention**: Still prevents duplicate punches in same range

---

## üîÑ Migration from Single to Multiple Ranges

If you previously had staff with single time range assignments, no changes are needed. The system is **backward compatible**:

- Staff with 1 assigned range: Works exactly as before
- Staff with multiple ranges: New functionality automatically applies
- Staff with no assigned ranges: Falls back to auto-matching any active range

---

## üìö Files Modified

- `app/Http/Controllers/AttendanceController.php`
  - `insertStaffAttendance()` method (lines 252-403)
  - `insertStudentAttendance()` method (lines 404-544)

---

## üéØ Summary

The system now supports **multiple time range assignments** per staff/student:

‚úÖ Retrieves ALL assigned time ranges (not just first one)
‚úÖ Loops through all ranges to find a match
‚úÖ Uses priority order for overlapping ranges
‚úÖ Accepts punch if it matches ANY assigned range
‚úÖ Rejects punch if it doesn't match ANY assigned range
‚úÖ Logs which range was matched and total assigned ranges
‚úÖ Maintains duplicate prevention per range
‚úÖ Backward compatible with single-range assignments
